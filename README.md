# Game List

This repository is based on PedroTech's MERN Recipe App tutorial on youtube. But instead of being a recipe app I'm gonna try to make it about videogames.

## Log / Obstacles

- Commiting the progress to GitHub makes using the database URI in the index.js file unsafe.
  - I installed the dotenv dependency, allowing me to store secret variables in a config.env file. This file is part of .gitignore so any changes won't be commited to GitHub.
